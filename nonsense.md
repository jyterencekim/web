> Don't, for heaven's sake, be afraid of talking nonsense! But you must pay attention to your nonsense.... Never stay up on the barren heights of cleverness, but come down into the green valleys of silliness.
 — Ludwig Wittgenstein, _Culture and Value_.

- Nonsense is not a *bullshit* in Frankfurt's sense.
	- You bullshit *away* when you don't *care*. You can talk nonsense while you do care.
